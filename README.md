# Maze-Collider-2
Maze navigation robot built with ROS 2 and C++  

This project focuses on developing an autonomous mobile robot simulation to improve skills in ROS, C++, and path planning. The simulation includes:

Robot control: Implementing motion planning and obstacle avoidance.

Path planning algorithms: Exploring A*, RRT, and other navigation strategies.

ROS integration: Using ROS for sensor data, localization, and mapping.

Simulation environment: Running tests in Gazebo/rviz with realistic scenarios.

1. Goals
Strengthen practical experience with robotics software development.

Gain hands-on experience with motion planning and autonomous navigation.

Build a portfolio-worthy project showcasing applied robotics skills.

2.Tools & Technologies
ROS2 (Robot Operating System)

C++ / Python

Gazebo / rviz

Navigation Stack / SLAM
